Nirvana is organizing **Bytes & Books: Readathon** to promote reading and improve focus skills. Participants can choose from various categories of books, and there are two levels of participation: submitting an abstract and sharing their learnings/ideas through a short talk.

Prizes include certificates for all participants, certificates of merit for the top 10 abstracts, and special prizes for the top 3.

## Motivation

One of the most important things in any intellectual profession is reading.

Whether you plan to join industry as a software developer, or work in academia as a Prof/Researcher, you will definitely need to read a tons of books,research papers and code/documentation.

In this age of youtube shorts and insta reels, our attention span and focus are severely hampered.

To develop reading and focus skills, and to gain back our attention from addictive/compulsive behaviours, we are organizing a Readathon.


## Categories

You can read any book you wish from the followingÂ **categories**:

1. Self Development & Personal Growth
2. Fiction
3. Philosophy & Adhyatma (Spirituality)
4. Science
5. Research Papers (outside coursework)
